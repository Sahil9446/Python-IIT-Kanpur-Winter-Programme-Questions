## How to Use

Each day, a new Python programming question will be posted. The structure of the questions and solutions will follow this format (I've taken an example here):

```python
# QUESTION DESCRIPTION (The Question Description will be in comments
"""
Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and prints their sum.
"""

# SOLUTION (It won't be in comments)
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# INPUT & OUTPUT (It will be in comments)
# num1 = 5
# num2 = 10
# print(add_numbers(num1, num2))
# 15
```
